    <P>Childhood living
        Is easy to do. The things you wanted. 
        I bought them for you. 
        Graceless lady. 
        You know who I am. 
        You know I can't let you. 
        Slide through my hands. 
        Wild horses. 
        Couldn't drag me away. 
        Wild, wild horses. 
        Couldn't drag me away. 
        I watched you suffer. 
        A dull aching pain. 
        Now you've decided. 
        To show me the same. 
        No sweeping exit. 
        Or offstage lines. 
        Could make me feel bitter. 
        Or treat you unkind. 
        Wild horses. 
        Couldn't drag me away. 
        Wild, wild horses. 
        Couldn't drag me away. 
        I know I've dreamed you. 
        A sin and a lie. 
        I have my freedom. 
        But I don't have much time. 
        Faith has been broken. 
        Tears must be cried. 
        Let's do some living. 
        After we die. 
        Wild horses. 
        Couldn't drag me away. 
        Wild, wild horses. 
        We'll ride them some day. 
        Wild horses. 
        Couldn't drag me away. 
        Wild, wild horses. 
        We'll ride them some day. </P>
